## Task 1: Structured Relational Data Model
Below are two images showing how I structured this data model.

**barcode** is the joinable key for tables **brands** and **receipt item** (many-to-many relationship); **receipt id** is the joinable key for tables **receipts** and **receipt item** (one-to-many relationship); **user id** is the joinable key for tables **receipts** and **users** (many-to-one relationship).
